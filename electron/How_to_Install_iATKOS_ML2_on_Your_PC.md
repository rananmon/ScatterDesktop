## Step 1: Download the Torrent File
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the torrent file for iATKOS ML2 from the Internet Archive[^2^]. This file contains the image of the installation DVD that you will need to burn or restore to a USB drive. The file size is about 4.7 GB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet speed.
 
## Step 2: Burn or Restore the Image File
 
Once you have downloaded the torrent file, you need to use a software like uTorrent or BitTorrent to open it and start downloading the actual image file. After the download is complete, you will have an ISO file named iATKOS\_ML2.iso. You can either burn this file to a dual layer DVD using a software like ImgBurn or Nero, or you can restore it to a USB drive using a software like Disk Utility or TransMac. Make sure you have a blank DVD or a USB drive with at least 8 GB of space.
 
## Step 3: Boot from the DVD or USB Drive
 
Now that you have the installation media ready, you need to boot your PC from it. To do this, you need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings. Usually, you can access the BIOS by pressing a key like F2, F10, F12, or Delete when your PC starts up. Look for an option that lets you choose the boot device and select the DVD or USB drive that contains iATKOS ML2. Save and exit the BIOS and restart your PC.
 
## Step 4: Install iATKOS ML2 on Your PC
 
After booting from the DVD or USB drive, you will see a screen with an Apple logo and a spinning wheel. Wait for a few minutes until you see the language selection screen. Choose your preferred language and click Next. Then, click on Utilities and select Disk Utility. Here, you need to format your hard drive or partition where you want to install iATKOS ML2. Choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) as the format type and give it a name. Click Erase and then close Disk Utility.
 
Now, click on Continue and agree to the license agreement. Then, click on Customize and select the options that suit your hardware configuration. For example, if you have an AMD processor, you need to select AMD Kernel under Kernels. If you have an Nvidia graphics card, you need to select Nvidia Drivers under Graphics Drivers. You can also choose other options like Bootloaders, Sound Drivers, Network Drivers, etc. depending on your needs.
 
After selecting the options, click OK and then Install. The installation process will begin and may take up to an hour depending on your system speed. When it is done, click Restart and remove the DVD or USB drive.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy Your Hackintosh

However, keep in mind that not everything may work perfectly on your Hackintosh. You may encounter some issues with compatibility, stability, performance, etc. You may also need to update some drivers or kexts (kernel extensions) to make everything work smoothly.
